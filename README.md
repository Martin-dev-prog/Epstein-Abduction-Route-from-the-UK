## Why This Matters
A child of four years should never have been moved under such shadows. This route bypasses normal customs and immigration checks, using private jets linked to individuals under serious investigation.

Each waypoint on this path represents a checkpoint where questions must be asked, records must be produced, and accountability demanded.

Call to Action
Authorities in the UK, Ireland, and the United States must urgently investigate every flight manifest, passenger list, and customs record linked to this route — especially for the aircraft with tail numbers known to be associated with the case:

N908JE, N212AZ, N120JE, N135AK, N474AW
